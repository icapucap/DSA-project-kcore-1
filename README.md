# K-Core graph for any network
This mini project is built for partial fulfillment of the course Data Stuctures and Algorithm.This project finds a subgraph in which each node has atleast some number(k) of immediate neighbours. That's why it's called K-core of the graph.

It is a subgraph in which all the nodes in that subgraph have at least a degree k. Here we are testing protien network which has a graph which will be created by it's iteraction with other protiens. There will be no self-edges in this graph. The code gives output a value k of the highest k-core in the graph/network of the protien

# To Run
Make sure that you have python3 installed in your machine.

Clone the repository go inside the `src` folder and type `python3 main.py` if you have different versions of python, otherwise type `python main.py`. This will give output of highest possible value of K in that graph.
